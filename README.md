# Protecting Rural Areas from Wild Animal Incursions: An Innovative Sound-Based Detection System


![poster presemtation (2)_page-0001 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95826757/230668088-a65ff4f0-b184-46f9-a9c1-ef3bbf0c4f88.jpg)



Wild animal incursions in rural areas pose a serious threat to human and animal life, as well as agriculture. To address this challenge, we have developed an innovative sound-based wild animal detection system called "Roar to Restore". This system is designed to detect and alert villagers to the presence of dangerous animals in the vicinity.

The Roar to Restore system uses a combination of sensors, sound recognition algorithms, and a sound-producing device to detect and alert the presence of wild animals. The sensors detect the movement and heat signatures of animals, and the sound recognition algorithms analyze the sensor data to identify the species of the animal. Once an animal is identified as a potential threat, the sound-producing device emits a loud sound to alert the villagers and drive away the animals.

The system is designed to promote the co-existence of humans and wildlife in rural areas and contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15 - Life on Land. By reducing the frequency and severity of wild animal attacks in rural areas, the system promotes human and animal safety, as well as reducing the economic losses associated with crop destruction.

The Roar to Restore project presents an innovative solution for the detection and protection of villages from wild animal incursions. The system can be easily deployed in rural areas and has the potential to be used as an effective tool for wildlife management and protection. By harnessing the power of sound, this system promotes peaceful co-existence and contributes towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15. 

We have implemented the Roar to Restore system using Flask, a Python web framework. The user interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily view and manage the system's settings, such as the detection range and the sound volume. The system can also send real-time alerts to the user's phone or email when a wild animal is detected, providing timely and accurate information to the villagers.

Overall, the Roar to Restore system represents a significant step forward in protecting rural areas from wild animal incursions. It is an innovative and effective tool that has the potential to save lives and livelihoods in rural communities.
