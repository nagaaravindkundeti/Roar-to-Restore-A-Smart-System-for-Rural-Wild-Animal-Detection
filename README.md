# Protecting Rural Areas from Wild Animal Incursions: An Innovative Sound-Based Detection System


![poster presemtation (2)_page-0001 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95826757/230668088-a65ff4f0-b184-46f9-a9c1-ef3bbf0c4f88.jpg)



Wild animal incursions in rural areas pose a serious threat to human and animal life, as well as agriculture. To address this challenge, we have developed an innovative sound-based wild animal detection system called "Roar to Restore". This system is designed to detect and alert villagers to the presence of dangerous animals in the vicinity.

The Roar to Restore system uses a combination of sensors, sound recognition algorithms, and a sound-producing device to detect and alert the presence of wild animals. The sensors detect the movement and heat signatures of animals, and the sound recognition algorithms analyze the sensor data to identify the species of the animal. Once an animal is identified as a potential threat, the sound-producing device emits a loud sound to alert the villagers and drive away the animals.

The system is designed to promote the co-existence of humans and wildlife in rural areas and contribute towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15 - Life on Land. By reducing the frequency and severity of wild animal attacks in rural areas, the system promotes human and animal safety, as well as reducing the economic losses associated with crop destruction.

The Roar to Restore project presents an innovative solution for the detection and protection of villages from wild animal incursions. The system can be easily deployed in rural areas and has the potential to be used as an effective tool for wildlife management and protection. By harnessing the power of sound, this system promotes peaceful co-existence and contributes towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15. 

We have implemented the Roar to Restore system using Flask, a Python web framework. The user interface is simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily view and manage the system's settings, such as the detection range and the sound volume. The system can also send real-time alerts to the user's phone or email when a wild animal is detected, providing timely and accurate information to the villagers.

Overall, the Roar to Restore system represents a significant step forward in protecting rural areas from wild animal incursions. It is an innovative and effective tool that has the potential to save lives and livelihoods in rural communities.

## Roar to Restore in Action
[230408_023518_video.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95826757/230679872-15a2d1d5-8dfa-475d-8fc5-b40e4a5ba5b5.webm)


The Roar to Restore system uses sensors and sound recognition algorithms to detect wild animals and emit a loud sound to alert the villagers. Watch how the system detects and scares off wild animals, while remaining silent when detecting harmless animals such as cows. This innovative solution promotes co-existence of humans and wildlife in rural areas, reducing the frequency and severity of wild animal attacks, and contributing towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 15 - Life on Land.

## Real-Time Animal/Person Detection with Computer Vision
[screen-capture.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95826757/230687057-b33acd16-49b7-47c4-91d8-7380e79b9e42.webm)

This project uses computer vision to detect and count the number of "wild animals" (hands) and "domestic animals or people" (faces) in real-time video. It's built with Python and Flask, and uses the YOLO object detection algorithm to achieve high accuracy. The project also includes a visualization dashboard to display the animal/person count over time. 

> Note: The use of the terms "wild animals" and "domestic animals or people" is purely for demonstration purposes and does not reflect any actual categorization or classification of animals or people.

<summary>Usage</summary>

#### CLI

YOLOv8 may be used directly in the Command Line Interface (CLI) with a `yolo` command:

```bash
yolo predict model=yolov8n.pt source='https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg'
```

`yolo` can be used for a variety of tasks and modes and accepts additional arguments, i.e. `imgsz=640`. See the YOLOv8
[CLI Docs](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cli) for examples.

#### Python

YOLOv8 may also be used directly in a Python environment, and accepts the
same [arguments](https://docs.ultralytics.com/usage/cfg/) as in the CLI example above:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.yaml")  # build a new model from scratch
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")  # load a pretrained model (recommended for training)

# Use the model
model.train(data="coco128.yaml", epochs=3)  # train the model
metrics = model.val()  # evaluate model performance on the validation set
results = model("https://ultralytics.com/images/bus.jpg")  # predict on an image
success = model.export(format="onnx")  # export the model to ONNX format
```

## Conclusion

This project is a great example of how computer vision can be used to solve real-world problems. By detecting and counting the number of "wild animals" (hands) and "domestic animals or people" (faces) in real-time video, this system could be used to improve security in public spaces or monitor the number of people in a building.
